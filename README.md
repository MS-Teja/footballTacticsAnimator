## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- You must have the Flutter SDK installed on your macOS machine.
- You need Xcode installed to configure the project and build the app.

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/MS-Teja/footballTacticsAnimator.git
    cd football-tactics-animator
    ```

2. **Add Dependencies:**
   This project uses several packages for its functionality. Open the `pubspec.yaml` file and ensure the following dependencies are listed:
    ```yaml
    dependencies:
      flutter:
        sdk: flutter
      image_picker: ^1.0.7
      flutter_colorpicker: ^1.0.3
      file_picker: ^6.2.0
      cupertino_icons: ^1.0.2
    ```
   Then, run the following in your terminal to install them:
    ```sh
    flutter pub get
    ```

3. **Add Image Asset:**
    - Create a new folder named `assets` in the root of your project.
    - Place your football pitch background image inside this folder (e.g., `assets/football_field.jpg`).
    - In `pubspec.yaml`, add the asset path so Flutter knows where to find it:
      ```yaml
      flutter:
        uses-material-design: true
        assets:
          - assets/football_field.jpg
      ```

4. **Configure macOS App Sandbox (Crucial for Save/Load):**
    - Open the macOS part of the project in Xcode by running:
      ```sh
      open macos/Runner.xcworkspace
      ```
    - In Xcode, click on the Runner project, then the Runner target, and go to the **Signing & Capabilities** tab.
    - Click **+ Capability** and add **App Sandbox**.
    - In the new App Sandbox section, find **File Access > User Selected File** and set its permission to **Read/Write**.

5. **Run the App:**
   Now, you can run the application from your code editor or via the terminal:
    ```sh
    flutter run -d macos
    ```
